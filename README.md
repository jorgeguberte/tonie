# Tonie
This app interacts with the Wed MIDI API in a way that allows the user to input MIDI notes and get visual and aural feedback regarding the input. 
I.e: it identifies - via the tonaljs  library - the chord that is being played, and plays the corresponding tones using the tone.js library.

## Features Roadmap
- ~~MIDI Input~~
-  ~~Visual feedback (keyboard on screen)~~
- ~~Aural feedback (notes via AudioContextAPI or possibly via a third party library if that's easier)~~
- ~~Triad recognition~~
- ~~Tetrachord recognition~~
